{"1": "Reduced the size of the array 'c' in the namespace 'BIT' from 5 times the size of 'n' to 4 times the size of 'n' to improve memory efficiency.", "2": "Replaced the function 'find' with 'check' to avoid redundant computations. 'check' only recalculates the array 'sum' when necessary instead of recalculating 'b' and resetting 'f' in every loop iteration.", "3": "Removed the unnecessary sorting of the array 'c' and instead tracked the minimum and maximum values in the array 'a' to determine the search range for the binary search.", "4": "Changed the binary search algorithm to check the middle value between the minimum and maximum values in the array 'a' for better efficiency compared to the previous method of checking in the sorted array 'c'.", "5": "Simplified the code by removing unnecessary macros and typedefs to enhance readability and maintainability."}
