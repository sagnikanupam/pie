{
  "1": "Changed memory initialization from `memset(f, 0x3f, sizeof(f))` to initializing only the first `k` elements of the array `a` using `memset(a, 0x3f, sizeof(a))`, reducing the initialization time from O(n) to O(k).",
  "2": "Modified array indexing from starting at 1 to starting at 0, eliminating the need for the out-of-bounds check `if(i-j <= 0) break;` in the inner loop.",
  "3": "Replaced the use of the `abs` function from the `cmath` library with a custom `xg` function to compute the absolute difference, potentially improving performance.",
  "4": "Added a conditional check before outputting the final result: if `a[n-1]` equals the large initialization value `0x3f3f3f3f`, output `0` instead to avoid displaying a meaningless large number.",
  "5": "Reorganized the code for better readability and efficiency by reducing the number of included libraries, minimizing the use of global variables, and improving code structure to enhance cache performance and reduce memory usage."
