{"1": "Replaced the usage of arrays (a and dp) with vectors (arr and dp). Vectors are more dynamic and efficient than arrays.", "2": "Modified the memory allocation for the vectors arr and dp to happen initially, assigning a default value of 0 for arr and a large number (999999999) for dp. This is more efficient than repeated allocation.", "3": "Replaced the loop for reading input elements individually with a read function that reads input into the vector arr in one go.", "4": "Changed the inner loop structure. The loop now starts from the element i+1 and goes up to the minimum of n and i+k+1, which reduces the number of unnecessary iterations.", "5": "Introduced a set of debugging functions (__print and _print) for better debugging and output. These are more flexible and efficient than using simple cout.", "6": "Replaced IO and simplified input-output binding with ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cout.tie(0); cin.tie(0);.", "7": "Used a single main loop that iterates over n to replace the nested loops, reducing complexity and improving efficiency.", "8": "Adjusted the final output to print dp[n-1] instead of dp[n], in accordance with vector zero-based indexing, which required redefining the ranges."}
