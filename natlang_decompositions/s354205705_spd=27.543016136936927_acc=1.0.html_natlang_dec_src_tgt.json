{"1": "Array Size: Change the size of the memoization array from a fixed size of 1000000 to n+2, which depends on the input size n.", "2": "Array Indexing: Modify the indexing from 0-based to 1-based. Initialize and start the loops from index 1 instead of 0.", "3": "Loop Range: Change the range of the inner loop. Instead of going from i+1 to i+k, go from 1 to m.", "4": "Variable Names: Introduce more meaningful variable names like 'd' to replace 'memo'.", "5": "Input/Output Speed: Add a macro 'ft' to improve input and output speed using cin and cout optimizations."}
