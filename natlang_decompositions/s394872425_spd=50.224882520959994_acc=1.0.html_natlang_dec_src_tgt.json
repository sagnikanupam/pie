{"1": "Replaced the array 'a' of size 2000000 with a single integer 'a' to store the current number in the sequence.", "2": "Eliminated the boolean array 'flag' to track appeared numbers and replaced it with a set 'used' to store the sequence of unique numbers.", "3": "Removed index variable 'i' to track iterations. Instead, the size of the set is used to determine the number of unique elements.", "4": "Changed the infinite 'while(1)' loop to a loop that checks if the current number is already present in the set 'used'.", "5": "Eliminated separate calculation for the next number in the sequence depending on array indexing and updated current number 'a' directly.", "6": "Updated the logic for detecting repeated numbers by modifying loop condition to terminate when a number repeats, using the set's count function.", "7": "Output the size of the set plus one to give the correct iteration count when repetition is detected."}
