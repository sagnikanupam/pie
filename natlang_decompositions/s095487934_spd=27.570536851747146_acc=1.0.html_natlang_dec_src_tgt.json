{"1": "Replace the array 'a' with a set 'set1' to store unique numbers.", "2": "Remove the initialization of the array with a fixed size, which is unnecessary for the set.", "3": "Simplify the loop logic by removing the count increment and existence check prior to processing the number. Now, directly divide/multiply the number.", "4": "Insert the new value into the set immediately after calculating it.", "5": "Check the size of the set after each insertion to determine if the current number was seen before, thus eliminating the previous conditions to check for existence in the array."}
