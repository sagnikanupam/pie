{"1": "Replace the array with a set to store the numbers. This change optimizes the time complexity of checking existence and inserting an element.", "2": "Remove the initialization of the array, as a fixed-size array is no longer needed.", "3": "Insert the initial number into the set.", "4": "Update the logic in the loop to simplify the operations: Apply the division/multiplication to the number whether it is even or odd first.", "5": "Check if the number is already in the set by comparing the size of the set with the current iteration index plus one. If they are not equal, it indicates a repetition.", "6": "Inside the loop, after updating the number, add it to the set.", "7": "Remove unnecessary increment of counter operations as they are not required in the new logic."}
