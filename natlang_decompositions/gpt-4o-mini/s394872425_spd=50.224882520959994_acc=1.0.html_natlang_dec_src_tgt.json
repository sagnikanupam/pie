{"1": "Replaced the array 'a' and the boolean array 'flag' with a set called 'used' to store the sequence numbers, which enhances memory usage and efficiency.", "2": "Removed the index variable 'i'. The optimized program now directly works with the variable 'a' to track the current number, utilizing the size of the set to handle iterations.", "3": "Simplified the loop condition by checking if 'used' (the set) already contains 'a'. This replaces the previous while(1) loop structure, making the code more straightforward and easier to understand.", "4": "Modified the calculation of the next number in the sequence to directly operate on 'a', rather than using an array element, improving speed and performance."}
