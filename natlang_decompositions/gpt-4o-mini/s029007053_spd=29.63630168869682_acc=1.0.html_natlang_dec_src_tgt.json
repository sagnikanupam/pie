{"1": "Changed memory initialization from initializing the entire array `f` to initializing only the first `k` elements of the array `a`, reducing initialization time from O(n) to O(k).", "2": "Modified array indexing to start from 0 instead of 1, eliminating the need for the out-of-bounds check in the inner loop.", "3": "Replaced the use of the `abs` function from the `cmath` library with a custom function `xg` to compute the absolute difference, potentially improving performance.", "4": "Added a condition to check if the final result equals the initialized large value. If it does, output 0 instead of the large number.", "5": "Improved code organization by using fewer libraries and reducing the number of global variables, potentially enhancing load time and memory usage."}
