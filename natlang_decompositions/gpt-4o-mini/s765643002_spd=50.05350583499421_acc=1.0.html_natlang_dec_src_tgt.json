{"1": "Changed the algorithm from a brute force approach with nested loops in the find function to a more efficient algorithm using binary search and a Fenwick tree in the check function.", "2": "Optimized memory usage by introducing an array 'r' to store the indices of the array 'f' in sorted order, improving efficiency in calculating inversed pairs.", "3": "Implemented code optimizations with inline functions and added 'ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);' to improve input/output speed.", "4": "Utilized a conditional optimization in the check function to stop binary searches as soon as a condition is met, reducing number of iterations and further speeding up the program."}
