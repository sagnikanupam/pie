{"1": "Reduced overhead by removing unnecessary library inclusions. The first program included libraries like <cmath>, <cstring>, and <cstdio> that are not used in the second program.", "2": "Replaced the two arrays 'h' and 'dp' in the first program with a single array 'arr' in the second program to improve memory usage.", "3": "Optimized the inner loop structure in the dp calculation. In the first program, the inner loop runs 'i-1' times, while in the second program it only runs 'min(k, i-1)' times, reducing the number of iterations.", "4": "Changed input/output methods from 'cin' and 'printf' to 'scanf' and 'cout' for faster input and output operations.", "5": "Improved code cleanliness and readability by using better macro definitions, reducing clutter, and organizing code more effectively for easier understanding and maintenance."}
