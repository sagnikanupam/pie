{"1": "Reduced the size of arrays 'h' and 'dp' from 1,000,000 elements to slightly larger than N, specifically using a size of 100010.", "2": "Changed the reading of elements for 'h' to start from index 0 instead of index 1, thus utilizing the whole array without leaving 'h[0]' unused.", "3": "Initialized the 'dp' array with 'INFL', which is a larger number than the previous 'INF', ensuring that 'dp[i+j]' is always less than 'dp[i]' + abs(h[i+j]-h[i]) for valid 'i' and 'j'.", "4": "Modified the outer loop to go from 0 to N-1 instead of 1 to N-1 and added a condition to only update 'dp[i+j]' if 'i+j' is less than N, avoiding unnecessary updates.", "5": "Changed the output to print 'dp[N-1]' instead of 'dp[N]', aligning the output with the problem statement of finding the minimum cost to reach the N-th stone."}
