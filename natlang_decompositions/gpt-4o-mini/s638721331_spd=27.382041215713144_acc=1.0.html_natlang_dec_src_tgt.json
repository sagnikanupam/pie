{"1": "Replaced the 'vector<int> A' with 'set<int> se' to optimize the storage and check for repeated numbers.", "2": "Removed the nested loop that iterated through previously stored numbers; instead, replaced it with a set's find method to directly check for existence.", "3": "Added a variable 'pre' to hold the previous number in the sequence, eliminating the need to access the last element of the vector.", "4": "Changed the initialization of the sequence to use the set's 'insert' method instead of placing the first element directly in an array.", "5": "Defined a variable 'now' to hold the current computed number instead of storing it in a vector.", "6": "Updated the loop to iterate using an identifier 'id' starting from 1, incrementing it with each iteration to record the position in the sequence."}
