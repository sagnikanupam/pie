{"1": "Changed the approach from top-down dynamic programming (recursion + memoization) to bottom-up dynamic programming (iteration). This avoids the overhead of recursion and the check for pre-computed states.", "2": "Removed unnecessary macros and includes. The optimized version only includes the necessary library and defines the necessary macros, which makes the code cleaner and potentially faster.", "3": "Removed the use of long long int where int would suffice. Using a smaller data type can make the program faster because it uses less memory.", "4": "Removed the use of fastRead macro. Although this macro is supposed to make I/O operations faster, it can sometimes make the program slower due to the overhead of synchronization. In this case, removing it made the program faster.", "5": "Removed the use of global variables. Although this doesn't directly affect the speed of the program, it makes the code cleaner and easier to understand."}
