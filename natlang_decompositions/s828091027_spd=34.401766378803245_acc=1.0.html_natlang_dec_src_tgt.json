{"1": "Removed unnecessary libraries: The slow program included numerous libraries such as <map>, <cmath>, <queue>, <numeric>, <climits>, <iterator>, <iomanip>, <stack>, <bitset>, and <functional>. These libraries were removed from the optimized program.", "2": "Removed unused variables and functions: The slow program defined unused variables and functions such as const constexpr int INF, vector<pair<int, int>> vp, struct Less, and ll GCD function. These were removed in the optimized program.", "3": "Removed unnecessary comments: Comments that were not necessary for understanding the program were removed.", "4": "Simplified operations: The operations in the loop were simplified by replacing the variable 'cnt' with 'ans' and using clearer calculations.", "5": "Used more efficient data types: The data type for some variables, like 'ans', was changed from 'll' to 'int' where applicable, although not necessarily shown explicitly due to the use of 'll' aliasing long long in the optimized code. Adjustments were also made to use constants directly rather than variables where possible."}
