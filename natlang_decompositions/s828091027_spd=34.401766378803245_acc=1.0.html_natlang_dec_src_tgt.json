{
  "1": "Removed unnecessary libraries such as <map>, <cmath>, <queue>, <numeric>, <climits>, <iterator>, <iomanip>, <stack>, <bitset>, and <functional> to reduce memory usage and improve compilation time.",
  "2": "Eliminated unused variables and functions including the vector 'vp', struct 'Less', the 'GCD' function, arrays 'g' and 'h', and the array 'v[51]', as they were not utilized in the program's logic.",
  "3": "Simplified the operations inside the main loop by breaking down complex expressions into separate, more readable statements:
      - Changed `cnt` to `ans` for better semantic meaning.
      - Split the addition operation into two distinct lines for clarity.",
  "4": "Removed unnecessary comments, especially those that did not contribute to understanding the program's functionality, thereby streamlining the codebase.",
  "5": "Optimized data types by replacing some 'long long' declarations with 'int' where appropriate to enhance performance and reduce memory consumption. Also, changed the typedef from `typedef long long ll;` to `using ll = long long;` for modern C++ standards."
