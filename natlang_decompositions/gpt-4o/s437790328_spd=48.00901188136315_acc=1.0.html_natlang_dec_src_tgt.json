{"1": "Array Size: The size of the arrays 'h' and 'dp' was reduced from 1,000,000 elements to just slightly larger than N, improving memory efficiency.", "2": "Input Reading: Changed input reading from index 1 to index 0, using a more natural array indexing in C++.", "3": "Initialization of 'dp': 'dp' array was initialized with 'INFL' instead of 'INF', ensuring the 'min' function always chooses the correct value.", "4": "Loop Bounds: Adjusted the outer loop to iterate from 0 to N-1 and conditioned the inner loop to check 'i+j' < N to avoid unnecessary updates.", "5": "Output: Updated the output to print 'dp[N-1]' instead of 'dp[N]', aligning with the problem's goal to reach the N-th stone."}
