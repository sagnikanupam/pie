{"1": "Replacing the recursive function with a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. The original recursive solve function is removed, and instead, a bottom-up dp array is used.", "2": "Removing unused code and comments. The original implementation includes some commented-out code and unused type definitions which were cleaned up for better readability.", "3": "Changing the way the minimum cost is calculated. In the original function, the minimum cost is calculated by iterating backwards; in the optimized version, it iterates forwards.", "4": "Using a constant for infinity. In the optimized version, 'INF' is used instead of a hard-coded large number.", "5": "Removing the 'initialize' function. The 'memo' array initialization with '-1' is replaced with direct initialization of the 'dp' array with 'INF'."}
