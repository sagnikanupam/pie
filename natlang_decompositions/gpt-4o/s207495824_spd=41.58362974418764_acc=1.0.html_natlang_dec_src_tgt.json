{"1": "Remove unnecessary libraries: Removed several unused libraries from the header, such as <cstdio>, <cstring>, <cstdlib>, <cctype>, <iostream>, <algorithm>, <ext/pb_ds/hash_policy.hpp>, <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>, and <queue>. Added <bits/stdc++.h> to include necessary components efficiently.", "2": "Efficient use of data structures: Reduced memory usage by optimizing the data structures. Used single-dimensional arrays with sized constants and bitwise operations for memory management.", "3": "Algorithmic optimization: Replaced the brute force approach in chk with a binary search approach through function check, which improved the time complexity from O(n^2 log n) to O(n log n). Replaced sorting and unique operations with more efficient indexing and counting.", "4": "Inline functions: Introduced inline functions read(), C() and G() to eliminate the overhead of frequent function calls and improve runtime efficiency.", "5": "Efficient use of variables: Decreased the number of variables used; b[] was removed as unnecessary for calculations and better array manipulation.", "6": "Use of bitwise operations: Introduced bitwise operations, such as swap(x,y), to replace slower arithmetic operations, speeding up processing.", "7": "Removal of unnecessary operations: Eliminated unnecessary operations such as the sort and unique operations inside the check function, thereby reducing time complexity and improving program speed.", "8": "Optimization of binary search range: Optimized the initialization and the mid-value calculation in the binary search loop at main for faster convergence to the answer."}
