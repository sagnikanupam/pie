{"1": "Optimize the memory usage by changing the array size. In the source program, the array `f` is 5 times the size of `n`, whereas in the target program, the array `c` in the namespace `BIT` is 4 times the size of `n`.", "2": "Avoid redundant computations by modifying the function that recalculates arrays and resets them only when necessary. In the source, the function `find` recalculates the array `b` and resets `f` every time. In the target, the function `check` only recalculates `sum` and resets `c` as necessary.", "3": "Make efficient use of built-in functions by removing unnecessary sorting operations. In the source program, the `sort` function is used on the array `c`, which is removed in the target program by using the minimum and maximum values found in `a` for adjusting the binary search range.", "4": "Optimize the binary search process by using a more efficient method of checking middle values. The source program checks the middle value in the sorted array `c`, whereas the target program checks the middle value directly between minimum and maximum values of array `a`.", "5": "Simplify the code by removing unnecessary macros and typedefs from the source program, which are identified in the target program for easier reading, maintenance, and debugging."}
