{"1": "Identify the unnecessary vector allocation in the source program: 'vector<int> v(2000001);'.", "2": "Remove the line 'vector<int> v(2000001);' from the source program to optimize memory usage.", "3": "Verify that the loop and main logic of the program remain unchanged, ensuring that the program still functions as intended, while being more memory-efficient."}
