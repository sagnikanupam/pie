{"1": "Replace the vector 'a' with a set 'st' to store the sequence of numbers. This change helps optimize the search and insert operations by leveraging the set's logarithmic time complexity.", "2": "Remove the separate 'calc' function as its operations are now integrated into the main loop within the if-else conditions.", "3": "Remove the nested loop that scans the vector 'a' to check if a number has appeared before. Instead, use the set's 'count' function to check for repeated numbers.", "4": "Modify the main loop to iterate until a repeated number is found in the set. Insert numbers into the set during each iteration.", "5": "Print the size of the set plus one to get the 1-based index of the repetition point after breaking out of the loop."}
