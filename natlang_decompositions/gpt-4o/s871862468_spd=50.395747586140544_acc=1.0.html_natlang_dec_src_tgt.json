{"1": "Changed the recursive approach to an iterative one: The original function 'fun' was recursive and is now replaced with an iterative loop in the main function which iterates through each element to calculate the minimum cost.", "2": "Removed unnecessary computations: In the optimized version, removed the recursive function calls and directly calculated the minimum costs using a dynamic programming table with iterative method.", "3": "Removed unnecessary variables and functions: Removed the template function for calculating the least common multiple and unnecessary variables. Simplified variable definitions and placed closer to their usage.", "4": "Used faster input/output methods: Added 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' for faster input/output operations in C++ within the optimized version.", "5": "Removed the use of the 'fabs' function: Replaced 'fabs' with 'abs' since abs is faster for integer inputs in the optimized version.", "6": "Reduced the size of the dynamic programming table: Changed the size of dynamic programming table 'dp' from 1000000 to 'n+1', which efficiently uses memory based on actual input size n."}
