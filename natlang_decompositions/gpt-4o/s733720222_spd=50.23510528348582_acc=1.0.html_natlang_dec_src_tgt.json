{"1": "Changed the approach from top-down dynamic programming (recursion + memoization) to bottom-up dynamic programming (iteration). This avoids the overhead of recursion and the check for pre-computed states.", "2": "Removed unnecessary macros and includes. The optimized version only includes the necessary library and defines the necessary macros, cleaning up the code.", "3": "Removed the use of 'long long int' where 'int' would suffice, reducing memory usage and potentially increasing speed.", "4": "Removed the use of the 'fastRead' macro, as it sometimes slows down the program due to synchronization overhead.", "5": "Removed the use of global variables to make the code cleaner and easier to understand."}
