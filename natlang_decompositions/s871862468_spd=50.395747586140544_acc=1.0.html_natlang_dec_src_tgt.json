{"1": "Changed the recursive approach to an iterative one to avoid function call overhead.", "2": "Removed unnecessary computations by directly calculating the minimum cost using values in the dynamic programming table instead of recursive function calls.", "3": "Removed unnecessary variables and functions, including the template function for calculating the least common multiple, and defined variables closer to their usage for better readability.", "4": "Used faster input/output methods by adding 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' to enhance performance.", "5": "Replaced the 'fabs' function with the 'abs' function for faster integer operations.", "6": "Reduced the size of the dynamic programming table from 1000000 to n+1 to save memory when n is significantly less than 1000000."}
