{"1": "Removed the unused template function '__lcm', which calculates the least common multiple but is not used in the program. This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary clutter.",  "2": "Changed global arrays 'h' and 'dp' of fixed size 1000000 to local arrays 'ar' and 'dp' of size 'n+1'. This reduces memory usage and prevents unnecessary allocation of large arrays when 'n' is much smaller than 1000000.",  "3": "Converted the recursive function 'fun' into an iterative bottom-up dynamic programming approach within the main function. This eliminates the overhead of recursive function calls and improves the program's performance.",  "4": "Initialized 'dp[0]' to 0 and set all other 'dp[i]' values to a large number (e.g., 'INT_MAX') to prepare for the iterative calculation of the minimum cost.",  "5": "Implemented a nested loop where for each position 'i', the program iteratively calculates the minimum cost to reach positions 'i + j' for all 'j' from 1 to 'k', updating 'dp[i + j]' accordingly using the formula 'dp[i + j] = min(dp[i + j], dp[i] + abs(ar[i] - ar[i + j]))'.",  "6": "Replaced the use of 'fabs' with 'abs' function when calculating the absolute difference between integer values. The 'abs' function is more appropriate and faster for integer inputs.",  "7": "Added 'ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);' at the beginning of the 'main' function to speed up input and output operations by untying C++ streams from C streams.",  "8": "Moved all variable declarations inside the 'main' function to limit their scope and improve code readability. This includes declaring variables closer to where they are used.",  "9": "Removed unnecessary variables, functions, and comments from the code to enhance clarity and maintainability."}
