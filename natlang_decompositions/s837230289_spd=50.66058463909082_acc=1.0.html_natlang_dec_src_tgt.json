{"1": "Reduce memory usage by changing the size of the array from 1e6 to 1e5 + 2. The array 'v' in the source program with size 1e6 is replaced by a vector 'a' and 'dp' each with size 1e5 + 2 in the target program.", "2": "Implement loop unrolling by modifying the for loop. The loop in 'minCost' function is rewritten in the 'ans' function. The loop start index is changed from 0 to 1 and the comparison from '< k' to '<= k'.", "3": "Avoid recomputation by storing intermediate results in the dp array and making recursive calls conditionally, based on dp contents. The source uses 'if(v[indx]!=-1)' while the target uses 'if (dp[c] != -1)'. Both serve to avoid unnecessary computations.", "4": "Optimize input/output by using 'ios::sync_with_stdio(false)', 'cin.tie(NULL)' and 'cout.tie(NULL)' in the target program.", "5": "Remove unused code and comments: The source had lines like 'freopen(...)', commented out transformations and definitions, and 'fast()'; these are completely omitted or partially adjusted in the target for a cleaner code.", "6": "Change the function name from 'minCost' in the source code to 'ans' in the target code. This likely reflects code cleanliness and possibly better semantic alignment with its functionality.", "7": "Change types for the vector and primary loop to integer to optimize memory and speed. The source uses vectors of type 'll' and the target uses 'int'.", "8": "Modify the approach in handling inputs, changing the iterative structure and how inputs are processed, resulting in a different but faster method of calculating the minimum path cost."}
