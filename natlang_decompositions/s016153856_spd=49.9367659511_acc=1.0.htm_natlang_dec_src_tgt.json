{"1": "Replaced the original recursive function 'func' with an iterative loop to avoid overhead of function calls.", "2": "Introduced dynamic programming by creating a 'dp' array to store minimum costs, instead of a recursive call stack.", "3": "Modified the input array 'arr' to become a dynamic array with size 'n+1' to ensure every index is used appropriately.", "4": "Incorporated the use of the min function to directly compute minimum costs instead of using nested loops for individual comparisons.", "5": "Changed the logic to calculate the minimum cost in a single pass through the array using a loop, leading to an overall time complexity improvement."}
