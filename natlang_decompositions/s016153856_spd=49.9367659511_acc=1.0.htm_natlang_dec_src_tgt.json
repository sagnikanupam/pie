{"1": "The recursive function 'func' was removed and replaced by a loop structure. This eliminates the need for recursive calls and avoids the overhead associated with them.", "2": "Dynamic programming was implemented by introducing an array 'dp' to store the minimum costs calculated for each element. This allows values to be reused and prevents repeated calculations.", "3": "The input data storage was optimized by defining arrays 'arr' and 'dp' within the main function, with sizes dependent on 'n', instead of using fixed-size global arrays. This optimizes data access.", "4": "A loop is used to iterate through the array, with an inner loop considering the previous 'k' elements for each current element 'i'. The cost is minimized using the 'min' function, ensuring efficient comparison of values."}
