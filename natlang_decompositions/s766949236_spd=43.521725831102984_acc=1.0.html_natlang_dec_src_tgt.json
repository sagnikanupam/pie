{
  "1": "Replaced the integer array `flag` with a boolean array `used` to track whether a problem has been solved (AC). This simplifies the logic and improves performance by using a more straightforward data type.",
  
  "2": "Changed the penalty count array from `penalty` to `A` and modified the logic to increment `A[a]` only when a problem is not yet solved (`WA` and `used[a] == false`). This reduces unnecessary checks when calculating the penalty sum.",
  
  "3": "Consolidated the sum calculations into a single loop that iterates over the range 1 to N, skipping unsolved problems. This optimization reduces the number of operations by avoiding redundant iterations.",
  
  "4": "Modified the input reading process by reading values `a` and `b` directly into local variables instead of storing them in arrays `P` and `S`. This change decreases memory usage and improves input processing speed.",
  
  "5": "Removed the `penalty` array entirely to save memory, as the penalty counts are now managed using the `A` array.",
  
  "6": "Eliminated the inclusion of unnecessary libraries (`map`, `queue`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `functional`) to reduce the program size and potentially decrease compilation time.",
  
  "7": "Added `#pragma warning (disable: 4996)` to disable a specific compiler warning (4996). While this does not impact runtime performance, it can prevent the compiler from spending time generating this warning."
