{
  "1": "Replaced the fixed-size array `a[2000000]` and the boolean array `flag[10000]` with a `std::set<int>` named `used` to dynamically store the sequence of numbers.",
  "2": "Removed the index variable `i` and utilized the size of the `used` set to determine the number of iterations, eliminating the need for an extra counter.",
  "3": "Modified the loop condition from an infinite `while(1)` loop with a break statement to a `while(used.count(a) == 0)` condition, making the loop control more transparent and efficient.",
  "4": "Changed the calculation of the next number to operate directly on the variable `a` instead of accessing and modifying array elements, resulting in cleaner and faster code. Additionally, updated the output statement to use `used.size() + 1` instead of `i + 1`."
