  "1": "Replace the recursive `solve` function with a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to eliminate the overhead of function calls and the need for memoization.",
  "2": "Remove unused code and commented out lines, including unnecessary `#include` directives and unused macros, to clean up the codebase.",
  "3": "Change the minimum cost calculation by iterating forwards from the start instead of iterating backwards from the current position, simplifying the logic and improving readability.",
  "4": "Introduce a constant `INF` to represent infinity instead of using a hard-coded large number, enhancing code readability and reducing potential errors.",
  "5": "Remove the `initialize` function and directly initialize the `dp` array when it is declared, simplifying the code and eliminating the need for an extra function call."
