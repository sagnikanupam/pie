{"1": "Reduced the size of the vector from 1,000,000 to 10,000 to decrease memory usage and the number of operations performed.", "2": "Changed the logic for checking if a number has been seen before. Instead of incrementing the value at the index corresponding to the current number and checking if it's 2, the optimized program stores the current number directly in the vector and iterates over the previous numbers to check for equality.", "3": "Modified the maximum number of iterations from 1,000,000 to 10,000, reducing operations and memory usage.", "4": "Simplified the calculation of the next number from an if-else statement to a single line of code, reducing the number of operations."}
