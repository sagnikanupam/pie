{"1": "Algorithmic Optimization: Changed the approach from recursive with memoization to a dynamic programming approach. The original solve function used recursion to determine the minimum cost at each index which was replaced with iterative bottom-up DP solution.", "2": "Input/Output Optimization: Replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout for faster input and output operations.", "3": "Data Structure Optimization: Changed the array used for storing minimum costs to a vector, which provides a more suitable interface and performance characteristics in C++.", "4": "Code Simplification: Removed unnecessary functions `valid` and `Fast` from the program which contributed overhead or had no beneficial utility."}
