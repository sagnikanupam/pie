{"1": "Replaced the recursive function 'solve' with a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to avoid the overhead of function calls and memoization.", "2": "Removed the unused code and comments to make the code cleaner and easier to read.", "3": "Changed the way minimum cost is calculated by iterating forwards from the start instead of backwards from the current position.", "4": "Used a constant for infinity instead of a hard-coded large number for the initial value of 'dp' to improve readability and reduce potential errors.", "5": "Removed the 'initialize' function which was used to initialize the 'memo' array, directly initializing the 'dp' array when it is declared instead."}
