  "1": "Removed unnecessary libraries by eliminating includes such as <cstdio>, <cstring>, <cstdlib>, <cctype>, <iostream>, <algorithm>, <ext/pb_ds/hash_policy.hpp>, <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>, and <queue>. Replaced them with the consolidated <bits/stdc++.h> header to reduce overhead.",
  "2": "Optimized the use of data structures by replacing multiple arrays and hash tables with more efficient structures. Specifically, minimized the number of arrays used and utilized a single Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for frequency counting, thereby reducing memory usage.",
  "3": "Implemented an algorithmic optimization by changing the approach from a brute-force method with nested loops and sorting to a binary search strategy. This reduced the time complexity from O(nÂ² log n) to O(n log n), significantly improving performance.",
  "4": "Introduced inline functions for critical operations such as reading input, updating the BIT (`C` function), and querying the BIT (`G` function). Inlining these functions reduces the overhead associated with function calls, enhancing execution speed.",
  "5": "Enhanced variable efficiency by decreasing the total number of variables and optimizing their usage. This included reusing variables where possible and eliminating redundant variables, leading to lower memory consumption and faster access times.",
  "6": "Incorporated bitwise operations within the BIT implementation. Operations like `x += x & -x` for updating and `x -= x & -x` for querying were used to manipulate indices efficiently, as bitwise operations are faster than their arithmetic counterparts.",
  "7": "Removed unnecessary operations and redundant code segments from the program. By streamlining the logic and eliminating superfluous computations, the program's execution became more efficient and faster."
