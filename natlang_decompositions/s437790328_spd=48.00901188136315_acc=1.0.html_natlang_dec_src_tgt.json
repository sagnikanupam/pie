{  "1": "Reduced the size of the arrays 'h' and 'dp' from 1,000,000 elements to just slightly larger than N to optimize memory usage and improve cache efficiency.",  "2": "Modified the input reading process to start from index 0 instead of index 1, eliminating the unused element and adhering to natural C++ indexing conventions.",  "3": "Changed the initialization of the 'dp' array from 'INF' to 'INFL', ensuring that 'dp[i+j]' remains less than 'dp[i]' + abs(h[i+j] - h[i]) for all valid indices and facilitating correct minimum value updates.",  "4": "Adjusted the loop bounds by updating the outer loop to iterate from 0 to N-1 instead of 1 to N-1, and added a condition within the inner loop to update 'dp[i+j]' only if 'i+j' is less than N. This prevents unnecessary updates and avoids accessing out-of-bounds indices.",  "5": "Changed the output statement to print 'dp[N-1]' instead of 'dp[N]', ensuring that the program correctly outputs the minimum cost to reach the N-th stone as per the problem statement."}
