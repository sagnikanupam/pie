{"1": "Replaced the use of two separate arrays to store values and positions with a struct to combine these into a single data structure for better efficiency.", "2": "Changed the judge function to a check function, which simplifies the logic and reduces operations. Implemented a binary search in the main function instead of a linear search.", "3": "Reduced memory usage by removing unnecessary temporary arrays and variables while initializing the bit array.", "4": "Utilized functions like update and getsum for common tasks instead of repeating logic, increasing code readability and maintainability.", "5": "Improved input/output operations by using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout for faster performance."}
