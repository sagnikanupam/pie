{"1": "Modified the data structures by introducing a struct 'node' to store value and position of each element in the array 'a'.", "2": "Introduced the function 'update' to update the bit array, which replaces the 'add' function. It iteratively updates the bit array as it traverses through it.", "3": "Introduced the function 'getsum', which performs a similar role to the 'get' function from the source code. It computes a prefix sum using the bit array.", "4": "Simplified and modified logic in the 'check' function, which replaces the 'judge' function. It now calculates the position index and sorts the array of structures 'arr'.", "5": "Changed the input type and input/output operations from int to long long for handling larger numbers with scanf/printf instead of cin/cout.", "6": "Changed the binary search strategy in the 'main' function to operate using the range of the array values, as opposed to sorted indices, thus implementing a binary search on the possible values instead of sorting the entire array at the beginning.", "7": "Implemented the new logic in the 'main' function to calculate 'tot', which represents the total sum up to n, as opposed to using 'ans0' for comparison in the previous version."}
