However, the faster program has a smaller constant factor, which makes it run faster in practice.\n\nHere are the optimizations that were made to the slow program to make it faster:\n\n1. **Memory Initialization**: In the slow program, the array `f` is initialized with a large value using `memset(f,0x3f,sizeof(f))`. This operation takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the array. In the optimized program, only the first k elements of the array `a` are initialized, which takes O(k) time. This is faster when k << n.\n\n2. **Array Indexing**: In the slow program, the array indices start from 1.

This could potentially be faster, depending on the implementation of the `abs` function in the `cmath` library.\n\n4. **Output**: In the slow program, the final result is directly outputted.

Array Size: In the slow version, the size of the arrays 'h' and 'dp' are unnecessarily large (1,000,000 elements), which can lead to inefficient use of memory and cache. In the optimized version, the size of these arrays is just slightly larger than N, which is more efficient.\n\n2. Input Reading: In the slow version, the elements of 'h' are read starting from index 1, leaving 'h[0]' unused. In the optimized version, the elements are read starting from index 0, which is more natural in C++ and avoids wasting one element.\n\n3. Initialization of 'dp': In the slow version, 'dp' is initialized with 'INF', which is a large but not extremely large number. In the optimized version, 'dp' is initialized with 'INFL', which is a much larger number.

In the optimized version, the outer loop goes from 0 to N-1, and the inner loop still goes from 1 to K, but 'dp[i+j]' is only updated if 'i+j' is less than N. This avoids unnecessary updates.\n\n5. Output: In the slow version, 'dp[N]' is printed, which is the minimum cost to reach the N+1-th stone.
