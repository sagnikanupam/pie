Then, it reads `n` integers into the array `a`.\n\n2. The program then calculates the minimum (`mi`) and maximum (`mx`) values in the array `a`.\n\n3. The program then enters a binary search loop, where it calculates a midpoint `mid` between `mi` and `mx`. It uses this midpoint to call the function `chk`.\n\n4.

It calculates a new array `b` based on `a`, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of 1s and -1s, depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is less than or equal to `k`. It also calculates the number of positive elements in `b`.\n\n5. The `chk` function then sorts the array `c` (which is a copy of `b`), removes duplicates from `c`, and updates `b` to contain the ranks of its elements in `c`. It also updates a Fenwick tree (represented by the array `sum`) based on the ranks in `b`, and calculates the cumulative sum of ranks in `b` that are less than the current rank.\n\n6. The `chk` function returns the total sum calculated in the previous step plus the number of positive elements in `b`.\n\n7. Back in the main function, if the result of `chk(mid)` is greater than or equal to a certain limit (which is calculated based on `n`), it updates `ans` to `mid` and continues the binary search with a smaller range. Otherwise, it continues the binary search with a larger range.\n\n8. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value that makes `chk(mid)` greater than or equal to the limit.\n\nIn summary, this program is finding a threshold value in an array such that when elements are converted to 1 or -1 based on this threshold, the sum of certain calculated values based on the converted array is maximized.\n        \n    ", "s733720222_spd=50.23510528348582_acc=1.0.html": "\n        \nThis C++ program is a dynamic programming solution to a problem where it finds the minimum cost to reach the end of an array from the start, given certain conditions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:\n\n1.

The `judge` function takes an integer `x` as input and checks whether the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `a[i] <= x < a[j]` is greater than or equal to a certain value `ans0`.
