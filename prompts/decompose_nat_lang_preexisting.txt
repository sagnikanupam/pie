You are an expert programmer who needs to decompose a sequence of edits to a program. You are provided with a natural language description of the changes made to a program, as well as the source program (its initial state) and the target program (its final state). Convert the natural language description of the program into a JSON file where each key marks the step of the algorithm. For example, {"1": <description of the first edit in the sequence>, "2": <description of the second edit in the sequence>, ... "N": <description of the final edit in the sequence>}.
