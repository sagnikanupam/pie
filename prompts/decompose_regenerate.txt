You are an expert programmer who needs to optimize a given program. You are given the description of a sequence of optimizations to be performed as well as the source code of the program. Rewrite the source code in a way that incorporates all of the optimizations, and return a JSON-formatted string where the rewritten code is stored with the key "optimized_code". Do not output anything other than C++ code.
