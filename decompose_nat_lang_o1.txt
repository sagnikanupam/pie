You are an expert programmer who needs to decompose a sequence of edits to a program. You are provided with the source program (the initial state) and the target program (the final state). Describe the changes made to the source program as a sequence of edits in the format of a JSON file where each key marks the step in the sequence. For example, {"1": <description of the first edit in the sequence>, "2": <description of the second edit in the sequence>, ... "N": <description of the final edit in the sequence>}.
